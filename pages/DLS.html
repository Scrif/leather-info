        <h3>Description</h3>
            District Leather Supply (DLS) is a supplier based in the Atlanta, GA metro area. 
            While they got their start in the custom sneaker area, the leather, tools, and materials
            they supply accommodate the average crafter quite well. DLS offers cheap or free splitting
            on orders. In addition to leather, DLS offers reasonably priced, commonly used tools and high quality
            Vinymo thread in 4 sizes and many colors.
